We are currently separating the web server and the development server (which 
are on one and the same physical server at the moment, hence you can reach both 
the website and the svn under the same domain name deadlybossmods.com)

The domain of the svn server will be changed to svn.deadlybossmods.com in 
order to move the web site to a different server.

PLEASE USE svn://svn.deadlybossmods.com/* INSTEAD OF svn://deadlybossmods.com/* TO ACCESS THE SVN SERVER FROM NOW ON.

Note that this is not a new repository, just a new name for the old repository. 
The old URLs will be kept available for at least a few more weeks. Note that 
your svn client might forget your login data if you change the URL. Send me 
an email to tandanu@deadlybossmods.com if you need to reset your password.

L.HelpMe = [[This litte mod helps to give a way the redo quests. For example, if you want to get repuation by the major factions, you have to turn in a lot of runecloth. With this addon you don't need to click each part of the quest like "accept quest", "ok", "complete quest". To use AutoTurnIn you just have to click on the NPC, all other is magic! 

If you have a stupid TurnIn quest wich is not supportet, please feel free to give use a short feedback at www.deadlybossmods.com]]
